# Version 9

This is the earliest version that TRView can understand, although the implementation is based on only one example (LEVEL3.TOM) so may be incorrect.

## Format

This format is split into three files: `.SWD`, `.TOM` and `.WAD`. The only known example for version 9 doesn't actually have the files for `.WAD` and `.SWD` but you can make a copy of the [version 11](version11.md) files and you will be able to see Lara.

The WAD and SWD files will be merged into the main file in later versions.
