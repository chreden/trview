# Windows
Aside from the [main 3D view](viewer.md) there are specialised windows for different elements of the level and route. These can be rearranged and dragged outside of the main view if desired.

Tables in most windows can have their column order rearranged.

## [Camera/Sink](camerasinkwindow.md)
Cameras and Sinks (underwater currents) share a data structure in the level so they share a window.
## [Items](itemswindow.md)
Lists items and their properties.
## [Lights](lightswindow.md)
Lists lights and their properties.
## [Plugins](pluginswindow.md)
Shows the currently loaded plugins.
## [Rooms](roomswindow.md)
Lists room and their properties and contents.
## [Route](routewindow.md)

## [Statics](staticswindow.md)

## [Textures](textureswindow.md)

## [Triggers](triggerswindow.md)

## [Viewer](viewer.md)

## [Settings](settings.md)
